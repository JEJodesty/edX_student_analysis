###Predicting Student Performance in edX using Browser Events
####By Joshua E. Jodesty

#####Objectives:
######A. Predict student outcomes in MOOCs offered by edX by performing classification techniques on student behavior captured by browser events, student demographics, and final grades - Create, train, and test predictive models with student logs.
* Outcomes: Certifications & Grade Range

######B. Determine browser events that affect student outcomes, by determining significant features for model performance, and through exploratory data analysis.

######C. Enable educators to make more informed descision to improve student performance by providing actionable insights about student performance

#####Value of Analysis:
* Provide individualized feedback that will optimize their study habits.
* Customize students' e-learning experiences to suit their demographic.
* Intervene when students are exhibiting behavior and fit demographics conducive to negative outcomes in a MOOC

######Data Scource:
[Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26147): 129843 Student logs from HarvardX and MITx MOOCs on edX containing student behavior captured by browser events, student demographics, and final grades.
